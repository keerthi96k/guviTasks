Browser js Vs Node.js
1) A browser js has windows objects which is not present in node js. Instead node js has global which has similar properties as that of windows.
2) A browser js has document which contains information about DOM. Whereas Node js has access to process, which provides information of the current process.
3) Browser has an inbuit interpreter for the js and a run time environment for running web pages on client-side. Whereas for Node js has a run time environment outside the browser.
4) In Node js the developer has the freedom to control the environment. In contrast browser js doesn't provide the flexibility of using the same browser as that of the end user.
5) The browser interacts with the DOM or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies most of the time, which does not exist in node js.
